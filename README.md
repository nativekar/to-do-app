What the heck is this app anyway?
This To-Do App was designed and built as part of a coding exercise for Fractal Analytics.

How does this work?
THe app offers the following rudimentary functionalities:
 1 The ability to create a Bucket and add ToDos under it.
 2 The ability to delete/update a Bucket.
 3 To Mark the ToDos as done, and vice versa.
 4 The ability to drag and dro buckets in order to rearrange them.
 
 Will the Developer be adding feature(s) in the near future?
 Sure. I'd love to work on it in my lesiure. What features have I in mind? Well, to start with:
 1 To add multiple ToDos.
 2 To be able to group multiple ToDos within a bucket.

 Is there more work to be done other than adding feature(s)?
 Yes. I still have to write Unit test cases.

 How do I run the App?
 To be able to run the app on your local machine, you'll need the following:
  Node/NPM.
  MySQL Instance.

Steps to be followed to run:
 Clone the app. run npm i inisde both the fractal-todo and todo-db folder.
 Run npm start from inside fractal-todo
 Run node app.js from inside todo-db folder.
 Without running app.js from within todo-db - you'll not be able to make calls to the DB.
 A local instance of MySQL is a MUST.

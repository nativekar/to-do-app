<h3>What the heck is this app anyway?</h3>

<p>This To-Do App was designed and built as part of a coding exercise for Fractal Analytics.</p>

<h3>How does this work?</h3>

<p>The app offers the following rudimentary functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li> The ability to create a Bucket and add ToDos under it. </li>

<li> The ability to delete/update a Bucket. </li>

<li> To Mark the ToDos as done, and vice versa.</li>

<li> The ability to drag and drop buckets in order to rearrange them. </li>
</ul>
 
 <h3>How do I run the App?</h3>
 <p>To be able to run the app on your local machine, you'll need the following:</p>
  <b> 
  Node/NPM.
  MySQL Instance.
  </b>

<h3> Steps to be followed to run: </h3>
<ul>
 <li>Clone the app. run <b> npm i inside both the fractal-todo and todo-db folder </b>.</li>
 <li>Run <i>npm start</i> from inside fractal-todo.</li>
 <li> Run <i>node app.js</i> from inside todo-db folder.</li>

<b> Without running app.js from within todo-db - you'll not be able to make calls to the DB.
 A local instance of MySQL is a MUST. </b>
 
<h3> Will the Developer be adding feature(s) in the near future? </h3>

<p>Sure. I'd love to work on it in my lesiure. What features have I in mind? Well, to start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add multiple ToDos.</li>
<li>To be able to group multiple ToDos within a bucket.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Is there more work to be done other than adding feature(s)? </h3>

<p>Yes. I still have to write Unit test cases.</p>
